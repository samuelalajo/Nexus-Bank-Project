In their pursuit of acquiring deposits, Nexus Bank has conducted various campaigns. However, during their recent board meeting, the directors expressed dissatisfaction with the current situation and emphasized the need to optimize operations. To address this challenge, the Director of Nexus Bank reached out to me, as they believe in harnessing the power of data to gain valuable insights and enhance efficiency.

****My Recommendations To Nexus Bank Are As Follows:

1. Highly Target Young and Middle-Aged Adults: These age groups have shown a relative interest in deposit subscriptions, with Young Adults having the highest percentage of subscription across all the groups. Campaigns with more youth-friendly models would appeal more to this age group. For the middle-aged adults, the bank can create plans that tie investments to retirement goals, housing, or other mature financial goals.
2. Loan Consolidation Schemes/ Loan Collaterals: Introduce schemes that allow customers to consolidate their housing loans with term deposits. With such a scheme, customers wouldn't feel overburdened by having both a deposit and loan simultaneously Or Using the term Deposits as part of the Loan Collaterals.
3. Customer Education: Ensure potential customers are educated about the benefits and security of deposit plans. An informed customer is more likely to subscribe.
4. Improve Customer Service: Ensure the bank's customer service is top-notch. Quick resolution of issues, transparent communication, and courteous service can enhance the overall customer experience and make customers more willing to subscribe to the bank's services.
5. Clarify 'Unknown' and 'Other' Categories: A large proportion of customers fall into the 'Unknown' category, indicating that their outcome of the previous campaign is not recorded. The bank needs to address this data gap. For 'Other', the bank should understand what this category includes and devise strategies accordingly. 
6. Improve Customer Experience: Across all categories, enhance the overall customer experience. This can be achieved through improved services, better communication, and listening to customer feedback to address any negatives. 
7. Data Management: Improve data collection and management, specifically for those customers marked as 'unknown'. Better data can lead to more actionable insights.
